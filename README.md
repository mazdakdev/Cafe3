## Smart Contract Integration

The frontend integrates with a deployed BuyMeACoffee smart contract that supports:

- `buyCoffee(name, message)` - Send coffee with a message
- `getMemos()` - Retrieve all coffee orders
- `withdrawTips()` - Owner can withdraw accumulated tips
- `getOwner()` - Get the contract owner address


## TODOs
- [ ] Watch for wallet change
- [ ] Deploy the smart contract to mainnet
- [ ] Deploy frontend to gh pages
